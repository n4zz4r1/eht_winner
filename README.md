"Winner" is a command-line tool that's being develop to help out ethical hackers, CTF players and cyber security
students.
Basically, it takes an XMind mindmap and turns it into a useful program that:

- Automatically serve tools under the `tools` topic. Examples could be reconnaissance and privesc tools.
- Automatically serve reverse shells from the `revshell` topic, using pre configurations like `LHOST`. Example: msfvenom
  revshell.
- A Command & Control (C2) Framework packed with different types of payloads.
- Sets you up with a cheatsheet search engine from the `cheatsheet` section.
